## Documentation for my resume template ##

As part of my learning guide I am also required to learn how to write technical documentation so this is my first attempt at it.

The site can be viewed here: https:\\suhadolnik.surge.sh\

### Introduction ###

I was tasked with writing a resume by cloning a design provided by the guide in HTML and CSS.

### Project objectives ###

To sharpen my HTML and CSS skils by building an online CV for maybe future use.

### Site user roles ###

Static site so no user roles.

### Functional requirements per user role ###

Again, statis site so no functional requirements per user role.

### Design specification ###

The design was inspired by [a resume template](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots/#screenshot2) provided in the guide. I simply used the same design and tailored it to some of my own personal information.

### Flow or logic diagrams ###

No programming involved in the creation of the resume, simply just HTML with styling by CSS.

### Success Criteria ###

Finishing the template clone was a success.

### Site map ###

The CV has a navigation menu (Hello and Portfolio have not been made yet, hence the dead links), header with name and occupation, an introduction paragraph. All of this is followed by two columns with information. Personal info, technical skill, hobbies are all included here. Below that is a footer section with contact links to Facebook, Twitter and GitHub. At the end a footnote with copyright and some other information.

### Content plan ###

Listed above.

### Marketing plan ###

None.

### Site maintanence ###

Myself will maintain the site when new information is added.

### Project timeline ###

The project started in late August 2017 and finished on the 23rd of September 2017.

### Budget ###

No budget since it was a personal project. All assets were created by myself or have been used with the appropriate licensing.
